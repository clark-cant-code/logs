Formless encompassing wonder
Cast in immortal orange steel
Towering spires crowned in cloud
Austere and beautiful
Free at last to all dreamers

She is the many faces
Of emptiness and still waters
And the perfect guided bow
Upholding a ribbon bright roadway
To each and every beating heart

Her sculpted arcs embrace the world
And every vessel gliding out
To the rolling open Pacific waves
Where the city and bay are one

She belongs to everyone
(How could I deny their passage?)
But she is everyone, too
The Golden Gate forever
